# GradPath

GradPath is an AI-powered academic planning assistant built around your existing Google ADK workflow. This repo now includes a full local web UI with:

- a modern two-column student/advisor experience
- a right-side chatbot for all user interaction
- a left-side read-only dashboard that updates only from GradPath analysis
- transcript upload support for `.json`, `.txt`, `.md`, and text-based `.pdf` files
- a FastAPI wrapper layer so you can plug in your current Google ADK agent without replacing it

## Architecture

- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI
- Existing planning logic: your current Python GradPath agent/tooling
- UI contract: the backend returns structured dashboard data and chat responses in one API call

The user only interacts through chat. The dashboard cards are read-only and are updated only from backend analysis results.

## How The Web Flow Works

1. The browser opens a GradPath session with `GET /api/session`.
2. The student types a message and can optionally upload a transcript file.
3. `POST /api/chat` sends the message and file to FastAPI.
4. The backend parses the upload, resolves a known student record if possible, and runs the adapter layer.
5. The adapter returns:
   - chat reply text
   - completed courses
   - degree progress summary
   - recommended courses
   - advising notes
6. The frontend updates:
   - the chat thread on the right
   - the read-only dashboard cards on the left

## Google ADK Integration Point

The UI is designed to wrap your existing agent, not replace it.

The main connection point is:

- [backend/app/services/agent_adapter.py](/Users/arunr3ddy/Documents/New project/gradpath/backend/app/services/agent_adapter.py)

Look for `_try_invoke_google_adk_agent(...)`.

Right now, the UI backend uses your existing normalized data and planning logic as a safe local adapter. That gives you a working site immediately. If you want the web app to call your full Google ADK multi-agent pipeline directly, replace that stub with your ADK session runner and map the result back into the dashboard schema.

## API Routes

- `GET /api/session`
  Returns the initial placeholder dashboard and starter chat history.

- `POST /api/chat`
  Accepts `multipart/form-data`:
  - `session_id`
  - `message`
  - `transcript` optional file

- `GET /api/schema`
  Returns an example structured dashboard response shape for frontend/reference use.

## Example Structured Response Schema

`GET /api/schema` returns data shaped like this:

```json
{
  "completed_courses": [
    {
      "course_id": "CS101",
      "title": "Intro to Programming",
      "term": "Fall 2025",
      "grade": "A",
      "credits": 3
    }
  ],
  "progress_summary": {
    "major": "CS",
    "target_semester": "Fall 2026",
    "credits_earned": 6,
    "required_courses_total": 10,
    "required_courses_completed": 2,
    "required_courses_remaining": 8,
    "percent_complete": 20.0,
    "total_recommended_credits": 9
  },
  "recommended_courses": [
    {
      "course_id": "CS201",
      "title": "Discrete Mathematics for CS",
      "credits": 3,
      "reason": "Fits remaining degree requirements, prerequisites, and term availability."
    }
  ],
  "advising_notes": [
    {
      "level": "success",
      "title": "Plan generated",
      "message": "Prepared recommendations for Fall 2026."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Transcript Upload Behavior

Supported uploads:

- `.json`
- `.txt`
- `.md`
- `.pdf` if the PDF already contains extractable text

Notes:

- Scanned PDFs without embedded text will fail gracefully with a clear error.
- Uploaded files are used only through the chat workflow.
- The uploaded filename is shown in the chat panel.
- The dashboard is not directly editable by the user.

## Running The Full Project Locally

### 1. Backend setup

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are on Windows PowerShell, use:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**PowerShell note:** If `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` gives an "execution policy" error, run this once to fix it:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then re-run `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`. Alternatively, skip activation entirely and call Python directly:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run_gradpath_ui.py
```

### 2. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

This creates `frontend/dist`, which FastAPI serves as the website.

### 3. Start the GradPath website

```bash
python run_gradpath_ui.py
```

That will:

- start the FastAPI server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- open the local website in your browser

## Frontend Dev Mode

If you want live React hot reload during UI work:

Terminal 1:

```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in what you need.

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
GRADPATH_USE_ADK_WRAPPER=false
GRADPATH_DEFAULT_TARGET_SEMESTER=Fall 2026
GRADPATH_DEFAULT_MAX_CREDITS=9
GRADPATH_FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

Meaning:

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: needed for your existing Google ADK setup
- `GRADPATH_USE_ADK_WRAPPER`: set to `true` once you wire your real ADK invocation into the adapter
- `GRADPATH_DEFAULT_TARGET_SEMESTER`: fallback term when the student does not specify one
- `GRADPATH_DEFAULT_MAX_CREDITS`: fallback credit load
- `GRADPATH_FRONTEND_ORIGIN`: CORS origin for Vite dev mode

## Reasonable Assumptions Made

- The current GradPath repo is primarily a local Python project and did not yet include a dedicated website.
- Student-facing dashboard data should be derived from existing normalized transcript/catalog/schedule data when available.
- If a student references a known ID like `s1`, `T1`, or `s1001`, the UI should use the existing data registry.
- If the current ADK pipeline does not yet emit the exact structured schema needed by the UI, the adapter layer should provide that schema now.
- Uploaded transcript parsing should work for structured or text-based files first, with graceful failure for scan-only PDFs.

## Key Files To Customize Next

- [backend/app/services/agent_adapter.py](/Users/arunr3ddy/Documents/New project/gradpath/backend/app/services/agent_adapter.py)
- [backend/app/services/transcript_parser.py](/Users/arunr3ddy/Documents/New project/gradpath/backend/app/services/transcript_parser.py)
- [frontend/src/App.tsx](/Users/arunr3ddy/Documents/New project/gradpath/frontend/src/App.tsx)
- [frontend/src/components/DashboardPanel.tsx](/Users/arunr3ddy/Documents/New project/gradpath/frontend/src/components/DashboardPanel.tsx)

## Troubleshooting

### Error 429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (Gemini API quota exceeded)

If you see this error:

```
429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: You exceeded your current quota
Quota exceeded for metric: generativelanguage.googleapis.com/generate_content_free_tier_requests
limit: 5, model: gemini-2.5-flash
```

**What it means:** The free tier of the Gemini API allows only **5 requests per minute** per model. You've hit that cap.

**How to fix it:**

| Option | Steps | Cost |
|--------|-------|------|
| Wait and retry | Wait ~21 seconds between requests | Free |
| Switch model | Change model to `gemini-2.0-flash` (15 RPM free limit) in your agent files | Free |
| Enable billing | Go to [ai.dev/rate-limit](https://ai.dev/rate-limit) and enable a paid plan (1000+ RPM) | Paid |
| Use a new API key | Create a new project at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) — each project gets its own free quota | Free |

To switch models, update the `model` field in your agent files under `agents/` from `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash`.

## Verification Checklist

After install/build, verify:

- the site loads in the browser
- the chat panel accepts text
- transcript upload works
- the dashboard updates only after the API responds
- placeholder states show before any analysis
- errors display clearly for unsupported or unparseable transcript files
